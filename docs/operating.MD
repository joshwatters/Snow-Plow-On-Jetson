To do:

1. Ensure static device addresses for the lidar and arduinos.
2. Ensure proper readings from each sensor: IMU, GPS, Lidar and digital compass.
3. Hard code the location into the python "serial read" for sensor logic and sick_scan_xd.py files
4. Adapt the current python files to integrate with the data read from serial and ethernet in the existing python logic.
5. Double back to rostopics for data logging if time permits.
